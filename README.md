The Homr Network was built to enable global Universal Basic Income for all 7.6+ billion people around the world using true data ownership, web3 fundamentals and blockchain technology.

In this paper, we offer an overview of the HOMR Network, a decentralised Web 3.0 social commerce ecosystem going beyond software and hardware, enabling users to earn a UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME by giving them ownership of their data.


In the ecosystem, users, to which we refer to as Homies, are able to post listings of various categories and types. 
By giving all ID-verified Homies the ability to create and sign Custom Smart Contracts, they can do things such as directly find a new Apartment on Homr, do a virtual viewing and buy it, or rent it without having to ever leave the App.
We will eventually allow you to tokenize any asset. From Companies, to Real Estate, Copyright, Intellectual Property, Labor and more using ALPHAWALLET Open source technology.



The network’s users can join both Communities and Neighborhoods.
Channels and Businesses allow all Homies to earn money from content, work, services, products, property and much more.
Members of them can vote for a leader every quarter or annually. 
 Jobs, Projects, Online and Offline Services, eCommerce, Mobility, Tickets and Events and many more use cases, enabled by tokenized local legal contracts in every jurisdiction globally. 
 
 
Though all prices on the HOMR network are interfaced in local currency, all transactions on the platform are conducted using Hombit ($HBT). 
Therefore HBT are 100% a utility token of the platform, enabling trade of virtual and offline services and goods in 100+ ways.
In no shape or form do Hombits represent a security, clearly aiming at global regulatory bodies like the SEC. We will tax all transactions with local VAT.
We are also going to enable global minimum hourly wages for services conducted, offline and online.

Founder Homr network

A new WORLD made for everYone.
AS OUR RECENT COLLECTIVE SHIFT IN REALITY TITLED COVID 19 STARTED TO CHANGE LIFE FOR EVERYONE OF US WORLDWIDE, THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESS OF THE GLOBAL SYSTEM WERE POINTED OUT.


AS OVER 20 MILLION JOBS WERE LOST, WE MADE IT OUR MISSION TO CREATE A MORE FAIR ECONOMY FOR EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD. 
ONE DEFINED BY GLOBAL ACCESS, SOCIAL MOBILITY, EQUALITY, DATA-OWNERSHIP, A DATA-BACKED CURRENCY AND FULL TRANSPARENCY. 
THIS SHOULD BE REMEMBERED AS THE UNIFICATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE ECONOMY, ENABLING UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME GLOBALLY.


WE ARE ESSENTIALLY GIVING BOTH THE ECONOMY & TECHNOLOGY BACK TO THE PEOPLE BY INTRODUCING WEB 3.0 TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AND CREATING THE WORLD’S LARGEST SOCIAL COMMERCE ECOSYSTEM, READY FOR AR AND VR.  


HOMR IS THE INTERPRETATION OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PUBLIC BY ESSENTIALLY ENABLING A DECENTRALIZED INTERNET AND P2P MARKETPLACE FOR EVERYTHING. 
THIS IS ACHIEVED USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTICALLY, TOKENIZING REAL ESTATE, PROJECTS, SERVICES, JOBS AND MUCH MORE INTO ONE UNIFIED LISTING ENGINE.
…AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOMR UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME (HUBI*)


A UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME ENABLED BY GIVING USERS DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF THE DATA THEY GENERATE ACROSS OUR ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM WHICH WILL GO BEYOND BORDERS GLOBALLY AND ALLOW DIRECT PEER-TO-PEER TRANSFER OF VALUE WITH INTEGRATED CUSTOMIZABLE SMART CONTRACTS FOR EVERYTHING VIA HEDERA HASHGRAPH AND MANY OTHER WEB 3 PARTNERS GLOBALLY, WELCOMED IN HOMR WEB SERVICES (HWS). 


OUR AIM IS FOR HWS TO BECOME THE AWS FOR NO/LOW CODE, WEB3, BLOCKCHAIN, AR/VR SOLUTIONS
HOMR AUTOMOTIVE IS REVOLUTIONISING MOBILITY AND THE EV INDUSTRY BY CREATING THE FIRST FULLY ECOSYSTEM-INTEGRATED ELECTRIC CAR FOR LESS THAN 15.000$ PER UNIT, GIVING OUR USERS GLOBALLY UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO GREEN MOBILITY FOR BOTH PERSONAL USE AND TO EARN MONEY ACROSS THE ECOSYSTEM VIA RIDES AND DELIVERY.
THESE IoTIZED CARS GENERATE DATA WHICH IS FED INTO HOMR BONSAI* SELF DRIVING ALGORITHM. DRIVER, CAR OWNER & PASSENGERS ARE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR DATA BY MAKING USE ON THE DATABIT STABLE TOKEN WHICH WILL BE DEPLOYED ON THE HEDERA NETWORK.


ESSENTIALLY WE ARE ADDING EV’S AS PART OF MODERN CITY MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE, AIMING TO CREATE FRICTIONLESS INTERMODAL TRANSIT.
THE SOCIAL NETWORK OF THE PLATFORM GLUES ALL OF OUR SERVICE AND COMMERCE COMPONENTS TOGETHER WITH A RICH LAYER OF CONTENT SUCH AS TEXT, PHOTOS, VIDEOS, SOUND, STREAMS, VR AND AR EXPERIENCES FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD. 


WE ARE PARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS TO CREATE NEW WAYS OF CREATION NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE.
HOMIES CAN MONETIZE CHANNELS AND USE TOKENIZED SUBSCRIPTION BASED OR PAY PER VIEW CONTENT AND CAN ADDITIONALLY EARN DATABITS FOR SPONSORED CONTENT, OR BY TURNING ON ADS BEFORE CONTENT.


HOMR NETWORK - COINING THE TERMS

DATA OWNERSHIP AND P2P STANDARD VALUE FOR DATA RELATIVE TO HOMBIT $HBT.

1 DATABIT = 1 DATA ATTRIBUTE 
1 DATABYTE  =  8 DATABIT 

DATABITS CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE DATA, BOTH AGGREGATED AND SPECIFIC ON A PEER 2 PEER LEVEL. THIS WAY WE ARE GOING TO ENABLE A UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME ON A GLOBAL LEVEL FOR ALL THE USERS OF HOMR THE HOMR NETWORK.


‘One yet untapped source of income for every person is the data about their behavior as participants in society. At present, this data is collected by large corporations (Google, Facebook, Tencent, etc.) and they use it for their own economic gain. The data is valuable, because you can recommend better products, provide needed information, or, in the worst case, manipulate people.
A person’s data should generate income for that person, in ways that they agree to. A person could rent out access to some or all of their data and let companies apply their algorithms to it for their gain. This obviously requires legislation that prevents companies from using personal data without consent. It also needs to prevent people from selling access to their data permanently so that rent from this data does indeed become something like an annuity.
Reasserting people’s ownership over their data is not a new concept. Many have asked to give citizens back their data autonomy and prevent tracking and usage of their data without clear consent. GDPR etc. are steps into that direction.
What is new here is the idea of a data economy, where a renewable resource, a person’s digital behavior, is turned into a rent to help pay for universal basic income.

WE BELIEVE THAT AT SCALE AND WITH A LARGE ENOUGH SIZE OF THE NETWORK, WE WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME THE SOURCE OF INCOME OF ALL PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.
OUR SOLUTION IS BUILT TO ENABLE EQUAL ACCESS ACROSS THE ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

1 DATABYTE STABLE TOKEN = $0.80



WITH QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT, EVENTUALLY EACH PIXEL , OR ANY OTHER DATA ATTRIBUTE WILL BE STORED INSIDE A DATABIT AND ENABLE US TO CREATE A TRULY DECENTRALIZED DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT.
The final goal for $DBT is to create a Quantum Blockchain. 
A  decentralized, encrypted and distributed database based on quantum computation and quantum entanglement.



We are creating the world’s first data backed crypto currency, truly owned and made by the people on our network, as their data represents the value of the currency.

HOMBIT FIXED SUPPLY 10.000.000.000
Once these are all minted, 
10.000.000.000 HOMBYTES WILL BE ISSUES FOR MINTING
These will require 8 times the number of Databytes needed to mint a Hombit in the year in which all Hombits were minted.

1 $DBYT CAN BE PURCHASED FOR $0.80
Other than to mint HOMBITS, DATABITS can be used to buy data on the HOMR ECOSYSTEM.
